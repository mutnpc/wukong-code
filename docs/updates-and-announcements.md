# Updates and announcements

Software updates and TUI announcements are separate channels. An announcement
never installs software, and the update channel does not depend on an
announcement.

## Explicit upgrade

Run either command to fetch the latest public version directly:

```bash
wukong upgrade
wukong update
```

The `update` command is an alias. An explicit upgrade does not wait for a staged
startup rollout and does not ask for a second confirmation after the command is
entered.

Current install-source behavior:

| Install source | Explicit upgrade behavior |
|---|---|
| Global npm, pnpm, yarn, or bun | Run the matching package-manager update |
| Homebrew | Run the supported Homebrew upgrade path |
| Native macOS or Linux binary | Download the platform ZIP and SHA-256, verify it, then atomically replace the binary |
| Native Windows binary | Open or print the current download path when in-place replacement is unavailable |
| Unknown source | Print a safe manual path instead of guessing |

Native automatic upgrade support begins with v0.0.13. A v0.0.12 native binary
requires one installation through the current install script before it can use
the new native upgrade path.

## Startup update check

Interactive startup reads a local cache and refreshes the public version
manifest in the background. Network and manifest failures are fail-open and do
not prevent the TUI from starting.

- Global npm, pnpm, yarn, and bun installations can install updates in the
  background. This is enabled by default.
- Native and Homebrew startup checks report an available release but do not
  replace the installation in the background.
- A successful background installation is reported on the next interactive
  startup with a changelog link.
- Passive startup checks may respect staged rollout metadata. Explicit
  `wukong upgrade` always targets the latest release.

The version manifest is served from `https://wukong.today/latest.json`, with
`/latest` retained as a compatibility fallback.

## Update preferences

Open `/settings` → **Upgrade** in the TUI, or edit `~/.wukong/tui.toml`:

```toml
[upgrade]
auto_install = false
```

`auto_install = false` stops background installation but keeps version checks
and prompts.

To disable the startup update preflight completely:

```bash
export WUKONG_CODE_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1
```

The legacy `WUKONG_CLI_NO_AUTO_UPDATE` variable is also accepted. These settings
do not disable an explicit `wukong upgrade` command or TUI announcements.

## TUI announcements

After the main TUI mounts, Wukong requests
`https://wukong.today/cli/announcements.json` once per startup.

- The request has a three-second timeout and never blocks terminal input.
- Network failures, non-success responses, invalid JSON, and unsupported schema
  versions are ignored.
- At most one eligible announcement is shown per startup.
- Announcements can target a client version range and a UTC time window.
- `once` appears once per announcement ID on a device.
- `cooldown` may reappear after its configured interval.
- `always` is reserved for active incidents.
- Text is sanitized before terminal rendering.
- Action links are limited to approved Wukong HTTPS destinations.

Only the display timestamp needed for `once` and `cooldown` behavior is stored
locally. The announcement body is not cached.

## Network and privacy

The announcement request does not include a Wukong login token, repository
content, prompts, or personalized query parameters. The server still receives
ordinary HTTPS metadata such as source IP and User-Agent.

The update manifest request likewise contains no repository content. Native
release downloads come from the public `mutnpc/wukong-code` GitHub Release.

## Compatibility

v0.0.10 and earlier use the previous announcement address and cannot read the
current announcement document. They must first upgrade through the independent
version-update channel.

An announcement endpoint must never be the only way users learn about the
release that introduces that endpoint.
